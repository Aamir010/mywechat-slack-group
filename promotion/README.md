**Ask active members to help us promoting this slack group.**

_Attention: avoiding doing that, when they don't feel comfortable and suitable._

- Use slack group in your daily work. It can be useful for more people, only after it's useful to yourself.

Example:

  [Denny] I personally use #today-learnings for personal daily review. #aws for my AWS questions.

- Ping #suggestions, if you can't find what you need or something makes you uncomfortable.

- Post real slack discussions to LinkedIn. And ask your connections to Join.
